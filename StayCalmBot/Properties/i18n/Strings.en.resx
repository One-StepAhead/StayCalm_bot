    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Shall we practice doing this?</value>

  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Step_5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This technique will help you see your emotion and let it go.

  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Step_9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We are glad that it has become easier for you.

If there are urgent matters, you can take care of them.

If you want to feel even calmer, we can repeat the exercises.

Or you can get acquainted with the principles of maintaining your condition in the norm.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We invite you to get acquainted with six principles that help you stay normal in difficult conditions.

For each principle, you will find a recommendation on how to use it.

Different principles suit different people. Choose the ones that are easier for you to perform.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>üîé The main principle. Pay attention to your condition.

It is important to know: stress is a natural reaction of the body in response to any adverse effect.

If you know that you are experiencing stress, you can manage it.

How to do it?

‚ö° When you feel tension, take a break from business and pay attention to your feelings.

Name the emotion you're experiencing right now.

üîé Perhaps this emotion manifests itself in the body. Where? Think about what muscles are tense now: neck, back, face?

Awareness alone is enough to trigger mechanisms that reduce stress levels.

If you want, you can massage and relax tense muscles.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>üßçThe second principle. Take care of your body.

The better your physical condition, the easier it is for you to cope with stress.

Try to fully eat, drink, sleep, rest, move - as much as possible.

The body itself will help the psyche to stay normal.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>üóìÔ∏è The third principle. Rely on habits.

Find habitual actions that you can perform regularly, even if everything around you is changing.

For example: drink from the same mug every day, make your bed, exercise, keep a diary.

This will help to keep the psyche in a working state.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>üôè The fourth principle. Do good deeds.

Every good deed increases your own resource. It works on a physiological level.

Even the simplest actions are effective: say nice words to someone, make a gift to your loved ones, help your neighbor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>ü§ù The fifth principle. Communicate with other people.

Communication is necessary for a person to maintain mental health. You can talk or just be around someone.

Speak out, support others, just talk about any topic.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Principles_6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>üß† The sixth principle. Observe the psycho hygiene.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set aside time when to check news sources and social networks.

‚ùó important - not immediately after waking up and not before going to bed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Don't get into arguments. Most often, it's useless - it will only increase your stress level.

It's OK to say, "Stop. I'm not discussing it."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MediumStressLvl_Step_10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Good.

Now you know the basic principles.

There will be more exercises and techniques here ‚Äî we will write to you when we add them.

If the stress level is more than 1-5, go to other sections of the bot by pressing the Start button in the Menu (next to the text input field).

There are exercises that will help you recover here and now.</value>
